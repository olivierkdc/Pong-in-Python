# PongGame
Making Pong! using Python library Pygame 

Here is my version of Pong!, built with the Python library Pygame.
This is step-1 of my project to code a Pong AI.

This is a two player version of the game, player 1 utilizes the W and S keys to move while player 2 utilizes the UP and DOWN arrows to move.
Press SPACEBAR to launch the ball at the start of every round.

Launch and run the Pong.py file to play the game!
